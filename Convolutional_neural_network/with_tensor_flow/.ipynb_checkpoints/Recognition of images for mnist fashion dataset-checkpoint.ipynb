    "The aim of the project is to use differents techniques of deep learning in order to predict type of clothes of the fashion mnist dataset the more precisely possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is compose of 60 000 images for training and 10 000 images for testing.\n",

    "## The code\n",

    "### Linear model\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin our training by our more simple model : a linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we need to import the packages we will need :\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "import tensorflow.keras as keras\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we need to create our linear model using keras :\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def linear_model(x, y, val_x, val_y, opt, loss_func, epochs, batch_size):\n",
    "    model = keras.Sequential([\n",
    "        # convert a two dimensional matrix into a vector\n",
    "        keras.layers.Flatten(),\n",
    "        keras.layers.Dense(10, activation=keras.activations.softmax),\n",
    "    ])\n",
    "\n",
    "    model.compile(optimizer=opt, loss=loss_func, metrics=keras.metrics.categorical_accuracy)\n",
    "\n",
    "    logs = model.fit(x, y, validation_data=(val_x, val_y), epochs=epochs, batch_size=batch_size,\n",
    "                     callbacks=[keras.callbacks.LearningRateScheduler(scheduler)])\n",
    "    model.summary()\n",
    "\n",
    "    return logs\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The model take in parameter :\n",
    "\n",
    "* The training and testing datas\n",
    "* The function of optimization\n",
    "* The function for evaluate the loss\n",
    "* The epochs (number of time the neural network process the entire datset)\n",
    "* The batch size (number of example given before the neural network corrige the weights\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we choose for the activation function the softmax because the sum of the output returned is 1 and its good in a categorical problem as it return a pourcentage on how much it thinks an image is a certain type of category or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we fit the model there is an argument called callbacks, what does he do ? This argument call every epochs the function scheduler :\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def scheduler(epoch, lr):\n",
    "    if epoch < 150:\n",
    "        return lr\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return lr * 0.9875\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function allow the learning rate to be reduced from the 150th iteration. Reduction of the learning rate will allow the neural network to become more and more precise between each epoch(from the 150th).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the main function :\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "    # mean the sum of errors and make only one backpropagation\n",
    "    # batch size increase the available computational parallelism and make it converge faster to optimum local\n",

    "So firstly we introduce hyperparameters epochs and batch_size and set it respectively to 300 and 1024.\n",
    "A large batch size will allow the network to process the data much faster but there at risk that it converge in global (and not local) optimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the loss function, cross-entropy is used as it is a good function coupled to the softmax functions as it penalized well the deviations between output and predicted values.\n",

    "As we can see, the loss on the testing test was as its lowest on the 38th epoch. Then the loss on training test is still increasing a little but the loss on training test decrease over the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It suggets that we are strating overfitting, the model start over-learn and can't generalize anymore.\n",
